# helloJavaWorld
Tutorial from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/helloJavaWorld/vignettes/helloJavaWorld.pdf. 

The package we will create in this tutorial, the helloJavaWorld package, will invoke a very simple Java class, the HelloJava-
World class, from inside an R function of the package, the helloJavaWorld
function. The objective is to help other people to make available Java algo-
rithms to the R world, be it to compare results, or for their own sake.
